			Traditionally, 3D modelling of the face has consisted of models learning an unfufilled representation of a face, using linear transformations or using vast numbers of matrices to hold various data. <br>
			<hr>

			The years of research has led to exciting and engaging animations in both movies and video games and facial recognition software has also advanced. Faces can be very easily represented using linear model. However, due to the linearity of these models, they cannot represent non-linear deformations. The human face is a very complex shape and it is affected by various many factors; and most significantly it deforms a great deal with any change in expression. <br>
			<hr>

			Changes in expression (deformations in 3D model) are very important when capturing the realism of a 3D face. Hence, a different approach is required. Convolution Neural Networks (CNNs). Modelling convolutions on 3D meshes is memory efficient, resulting in high resolution 3D structures to be processed. <br>
			However, an issue with training CNNs on high resolution 3D strucutres is simply the lack of 3D datasets.
